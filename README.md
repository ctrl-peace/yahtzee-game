# Yahtzee Game in Java

This project is a Yahtzee game implemented in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing library. Players can roll dice, hold dice, and score various combinations just like the traditional Yahtzee game. This project was originally created in 2024, but I uploaded it to GitHub in 2025.

## Features

- 2-player support
- Dice rolling functionality with dice hold options
- Scoring table with categories such as Ones, Fours, Three of a Kind, Yahtzee, and more
- Interactive GUI with dice images
- Replay functionality to reset the game
- Scoring calculations based on standard Yahtzee rules

## Requirements

- **Java 8 or higher** (Recommended: JDK 8 or later)
- A working IDE or text editor that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)
